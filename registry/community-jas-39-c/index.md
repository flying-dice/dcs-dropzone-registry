# Community-JAS-39-C
Welcome to our GitHub for the JAS-39-C Gripen mod for DCS!

Our team is passionate about aviation and DCS, and we wanted to bring the JAS-39 Gripen to the simulator. We started working on the mod in February 2021, and in a short amount of time, we have achieved a basic FC3 module. We have put a lot of effort into the mod and have added several features to enhance the user experience. Our main focus has been on creating an authentic and immersive cockpit that accurately represents the Gripen's instruments and controls. We have also added unique weapons and made modifications to the SFM to make it as realistic as possible, taking feedback from Gripen SMEs into consideration. We are grateful to the Community A-4E-C team, Grinnelli, Freebird, Gonzalodesanta, Megalax, Isak, 313_Paegas, Krieger, and VSN Team for their support and contributions. Without their help, this project would not have been possible. We are excited to share our mod with the DCS community and welcome anyone who shares our passion to join us on Discord to learn more about the project.

## Installation

1) Download the latest release at https://github.com/whisky-actual/Community-JAS-39-C/releases select **assets** -> Source code (zip)
2) Open the zip and go inside the first folder that will have the release name
3) Select the **Mods** folder and drop it under `C:\Users\username\Saved Games\DCS` (username will vary on your machine and DCS could be DCS beta)

## Installation Troubleshooting

If your game fails to launch maybe the JAS39 mod is conflicting with another one. We suggest removing all of the mods found in `C:\Users\username\Saved Games\DCS\Mods\`. You can add your mods back one at a time and see which one conflicts.

## Frequently Asked Questions
- **Q: Do you need FC3 to use the module?**
  - Yes for the BVR variant (F15) (not free)
  - Yes for the WVR (SU33) (not free)
  - No for the AG variant since it uses the SU25T avionics (free)
- **Q: Do we plan to make it a standalone?**
  - We are working on it for v2.0, but no promises since we are still exploring the limits of development without the SDK.
- **Q: Do we need test pilots?**
  - Not currently, thank you.
- **Q: Do we plan to have a D model (two seater)?**
  - No, focus will be on the Charlie model.
- **Q: My keybinds don't work (axis, brakes, etc.)**
  - The Gripen has specail keybinds and axis, you will need to bind them before flying.
- **Why can't I fire my tv guided bomb (this includes the GBU-39 SDB)? **
  - There is a conflict with other mods, try disabling them and it should fire as intended.
- **How can I support the mod/team?? **
  - We currently do not have a paypal set up, so here are some ways you can support the development:
    Learn 3D, 2D, coding etc and join the dev team. Help us recruit members to fill gaps in the team. Constructively report bugs and inaccuracies. Contribute to discussions or questions in this Discord. Watch, like and subscribe to content creators who support our mod through trailers as well as tutorial. 
- **Q: Will the JAS39 mod pass IC?**
  - Yes, but a public server will need to have the same version for it to work properly.
- **Q: I can't fire!**
  - There are two safety mechanisms modeled. First, you need to put the master arm switch to "Live". Look for a big knob surrounded by red and white stripes on the right-hand side of the cockpit ([video](https://youtu.be/uRtXBdGcmMY?t=945)). You can also keybind this (<kbd>MASS Live</kbd>, <kbd>MASS Standby</kbd> and <kbd>MASS Safe</kbd>). Second, whenever you shoot, you have to depress (or toggle) the trigger safe (<kbd>Trigger Safe - Hold</kbd> or <kbd>Trigger Safe - Switch</kbd>). If you only press the <kbd>Trigger</kbd> without releasing the trigger safe, nothing will happen.
