VSN F-104 Starfighter pack.

The free mod for the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter in the versions C, G, S, (S_AG), NF-104A.
The mod is FC3 based, so F-15C is needed.
To fly the F-15C based versions (C, G, S, NF) it is recommended to set a F-15C in the mission, put it on late activation and jump into that plane before entering the F-104 cockpit, to preload the 
F-15C DLLs until ED has fixed this issue.
