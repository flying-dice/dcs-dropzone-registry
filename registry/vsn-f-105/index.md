A free Republic F-105 Thunderchief FC3-based flyable mod for DCS-World



## Guide

- 

## Installation

- In the mission editor, make sure the Historical Filter is disabled
- PLEASE be aware, that ED changed the way FC3 mods can be used. Since the F-105D and G use SU-27 Cockpit and SU-25T avionics, you need to jump into a SU-27 BEFORE flying any mission with the F-105D or G.

## Changelog

### 2.9.10.103

#### Bugs/Corrections

- FC3- Problems mostly resolved
- Drag-Chute flickering still persistent
