# DCS World A-29B Super Tucano

This is a free open source EFM A-29B independent module for DCS World. By independent it is meant that it does not require any other modules to work.

The development is in a very early stage, but the author has decided on releasing it in hopes it will help others on the implementation of modern aircraft systems using EFM/SFM.

All aircraft systems implemented in Lua can be freely used in other non-paid DCS World Modules.
All aircraft systems implemented in C++ can be freely used in other non-paid public open-source DCS World Modules on request.
