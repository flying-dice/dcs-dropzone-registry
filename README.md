## üìù Markdown Files

The `index.md` and `latest.md` markdown files serve as the primary source of information for your mod. These files are parsed using [gray-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter) and support formats like TOML, JSON, and YAML.

### Markdown Structure
Use the following front matter format in your markdown files:
```markdown
---
# Metadata Fields
---
# Content
```
Refer to the [example-mod](registry/example-mod) for detailed examples.

### `index.md`
This file contains your mod‚Äôs metadata and serves as the description displayed to users when they view your mod‚Äôs page. Check the documentation for available metadata fields.

### `latest.md`
This file defines the latest version of your mod, including:
- **Assets**: Files to be downloaded and installed.
- **Target Field**: Specify installation paths using templated DCS variables:
    - `{{DCS_INSTALL_DIR}}`: DCS installation directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Eagle Dynamics\DCS World`).
    - `{{DCS_USER_DIR}}`: DCS user directory (e.g., `%USERPROFILE%\Saved Games\DCS`).

The content of this file is displayed to users when they open the release information modal.
